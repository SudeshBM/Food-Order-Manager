It is designed to help users manage product information seamlessly. The Order Management System allows users to perform essential operations such as adding new products, updating existing product details, deleting unwanted products, and retrieving product information from the database. Features Add New Products Users can create new product entries by providing relevant details such as product name, price, category, and stock information. Update Product Information Existing product details can be edited and updated in real time, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information. Delete Products Users can remove products that are no longer needed or relevant. Retrieve Product Data The system displays a list of all products stored in the database, enabling users to easily access the details they need. Tech Stack This project leverages the following technologies: MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing product data. Express.js: A lightweight backend framework to handle server-side logic and API routes. React.js: A modern frontend library for building user-friendly interfaces. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building the backend server. Key Highlights RESTful APIs: The project uses RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations effectively. Responsive UI: The user interface is designed to provide a seamless experience across different devices. Scalable Design: Built with scalability in mind, making it easy to add new features or expand functionalities. Real-Time Updates: Changes in the database are reflected instantly on the frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience. How It Works Frontend (React.js): The frontend communicates with the backend API to send and receive data. It provides a clean, interactive UI for managing products. Backend (Node.js & Express.js): The backend processes requests, performs validations, and interacts with the database to execute CRUD operations. Database (MongoDB): MongoDB stores all product data in a flexible, document-oriented structure. Use Case This project can serve as the foundation for managing inventory, orders, or any system that requires CRUD operations. It is suitable for learning and practical purposes, such as small-scale e-commerce platforms, inventory tracking systems, or product catalog management. Future Enhancements Implement user authentication for secure access. Add search and filtering options for easy navigation of products. Integrate pagination for large datasets. Extend functionality to manage orders, customers, and reports. This Order Management System is a great starting point for understanding the MERN stack and building scalable web applications. It combines best practices in frontend and backend development with a clean, modular structure.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 6,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n      children: \"...\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 53,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 5,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n_c = About;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"About\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","About","className","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["D:/Inventry Management System/Inventory-Management-System-MERN-CRUD-App/Frontend/inventory_management_system/src/components/About.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default function About() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className='container-fluid p-5'>\r\n        <h1>This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
